Optosynth is a python package for generating synthetic voltage imaging ("Optopatch") data using empirical morphological reconstructions and paired electrophysiology measurements from Allen Brain single-neuron database.

Optosynth currently simulates the following aspects of voltage imaging data:

- spatial variability in expression of archaerhodopsin
- action potential dendritic backpropagation
- voltage propagation decay
- lowpass filtering of electrophysiology measurements according to the camera sampling rate
- conversion of voltage to fluorescence
- static and dynamic background fluorescence
- variability in global fluorescence intensity of individual neurons (i.e. tissue depth)
- Gaussian PSF
- Poisson-Gaussian camera noise

The synthetic data generated by Optosynth is extremely realistic and can be used for benchmarking denoising, spike detection, and segmentation pipelines.

Future plans include:

- multi-threading
- removing redundant parameters
- camera motion modeling (towards synthetic _in vivo_ data)
- better reconstruction of soma (currently cicular -- Allen SDK only provides center coordinates and radius)
- 3D tissue/culture synthesis and 3D point spread function (currently, the reconstruction is purely 2D)

Requirements
============

Optosynth requires the following python modules:

- `allensdk`
- `Pillow>7.0.0` (having the right version is extremely important -- Optosynth produces bad data with older versions of `Pillow`)
- `boltons`
- `tqdm`
- `torch`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`

We will eventually package Optosynth into a proper python module. At the moments, the user must install the requirements manually.

Notebooks
=========

- `download_allen_data.ipynb`: downloads relevant data from Allen Brain
- `process_allen_morphology.ipynb`: processes morphological reconstructions and generates binary masks for each neuron
- `process_allen_elecrophysiology.ipynb`: processes electrophysiology data, retains only square pulses, and generates a manifest of retain sweeps along with useful metadata (stimulation current, number of spikes, etc)
- `optosynth_main.ipynb`: generates and saves synthetic data, explores some aspect of the generated data
